# Old People and People with Medical Issues

People above 70 years of age and people with medical issues either currently or previously are at the most risk from COVID-19. This data shows the elderly are at a much greater risk than young people.

| Age Group | Mortality Rate % |
| :--- | ---: |
| 80 + | 14.8 % |
| 70 - 79 | 8 % |
| 50 - 59 | 1.3% |
| 40 - | &lt; 0.5 % |

With the available data there are no reported deaths of children under 10 years of age, and children seem to have a very low mortality rate from COVID-19.

The people with preexisting medical conditions tell a similar story. People with underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk than people without any predisposed medical condition. \([source](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#case-fatality-rate-of-covid-19-by-preexisting-health-conditions)\)

| Medical Condition | Mortality Rate % |
| :--- | ---: |
| Cardiovascular Disease | 10.5 % |
| Diabetes | 7.3 % |
| Chronic Respiratory Disease | 6.3 % |
| Hypertension | 6.0 % |
| Cancer | 5.6 % |
| No Health Condition | 0.9 % |
